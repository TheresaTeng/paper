# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa
Partical size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).
Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Motivation
Find out more about this important phenomenon.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transoorted away from the source region

# Results
The simulations indicate taht coagulation is the dominent growth mechanism for these particles.


#Methodology
We compared our measurements of particle aging with a model simulation. The model is details in Smith et al (2002).


This is the new thing
